# 8-PUZZLE-SOLVER
The 8-puzzle is a 3x3 sliding tile puzzle. To solve it, check solvability using inversions, represent states efficiently, and use algorithms like BFS (shortest path) or A* (with heuristics like Manhattan Distance). Track visited states, optimize searches, and reconstruct the solution path to achieve the goal.
